== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### What is the Meta Pixel?

The Meta Pixel is a powerful analytics tool that helps you track visitor activity on your website. It enables you to measure the effectiveness of your advertising by understanding the actions people take on your site. When integrated with WooCommerce, the Meta Pixel can track activities like page visits or items added to carts, helping refine your advertising campaigns.

#### How does the Meta Conversions API complement the Meta Pixel?

The Meta Conversions API works alongside the Meta Pixel to enhance the measurement and optimization of your ad campaigns.
